# Speak-With-Python-Season-1
**Showcasing the effectiveness of python in data analysis**
## Project 1
### Football Analyst/Commentator: 
I have a dataset of the Spanish Football League [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ricardomoya/football-matches-of-spanish-league). It contains home and away results of Spanish football teams from 1970 to 2018, for League 1 and 2.
### Python: 
What do you need?
### Commentator: 
I need season by season results showing the calculations of the necessary indicators contained in conventional league table, starting from the team with the highest points in the season down to the relegated teams.
### 
Python: You need the league tables of all seasons from the 1970 season, one table each for league 1 and 2?
### Commentator:
I want calculated indicators, because calculations allows for flexibilities while tables are usually rigid. Calculations allow me to search a particular team or some teams in a season or over a number of seasons. Also give me a total season by season summary. Finally, I will like the same body of codes to run for all season. I just want to scroll through or search the results from 1970 to 2018. Remember to indicate the search section, where I can input my search
### Python: 
Do you care about the length of the codes?
### Commentator: 
Stop grandstanding and get to work. Lest I forget, every word or line of this report MUST be code generated. Opinions are not needed
### Python:
Here is your report.
### Commentator:
What is unique about this report?
### Python:
The question should be: what is unique about list comprehension?  It is useful for automating predictable reporting on data and you can generate continuous steams of reports with every additional data. If and when you add seasons 2019 to 2021, the same code will come up with the same level of report without additional codes. We hope to showcase the depth of this function as we proceed this season.
